1/2 to 1 lb. dry rolled oats

1 5.3-oz. box puffed wheat cereal - Malt-O-Meal, Quaker, or Kashi. Cheerios can be a viable alternative, but remember that there may be added sugar.

1 6.4-oz. box puffed rice cereal - Quaker is the best brand as it contains no sugar. Rice Krispies are not recommended because of their salt and sugar content.

1 12-oz. box Total Cereal; Some people think Total has too many vitamins, but keep in mind that on average, a rat will eat one or two flakes a day.

1/4 to 1/2 lb. roasted, unsalted soy nuts - High in protein but contain valuable cancer-preventing agents, so they are a good addition to the mix. Roasted soybeans are also a good source of vitamin K.

1/2 lb dried fruits - Bananas and cranberries are great to add because bananas are a good source of potassium, and cranberries are good for the urinary tract. (If you would rather use fresh fruits, that's fine. Just place them in a separate bowl so they will not mush the other dry content.)

1/2 lb dry pasta - The tri-colored elbow noodles with a spinach and tomato flavor work well and are crunchy, which can help their teeth. Noodles are a good source of carbohydrates, which helps balance the protein in the soy nuts, as well.

1/4 lb sunflower seeds - Make sure they are unshelled and not salted.

1/4 lb muesli - (optional)
