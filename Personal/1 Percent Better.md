• Stretch for 10 minutes a day. Feel free to do it during another task.
• Set up drywall station and cut at least 5 drywall patches a week (figure out a creative way to keep track - some people do rocks?)

• Read 1 page of a book a day.
• When doing the rat laundry, when it's time to fold, make parcels for the top and bottom levels respectively.
• Meditate for at least 5 minutes a day.
• Set up the drywall station for the next step.
