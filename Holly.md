I want to be acknowledged 

You make me feel unimportant

H: "You might have some memory problem"

This is a hurtful statement that makes me feel manipulated

H: "You haven't been acting like yourself ever since therapy"

Holly thinks it's good to talk through things when emotions are high

I explained that it's good for me to cool off

Acknowledged she was being mean and still didn't apologize 

I feel ignored and numb and angry and inferior when you won't apologize even after I showed an example.
